A 49er was tired of tired of mining GOLD what happened; well it is the 1849 gold rush in CA.well How did it start it started in 1848 when James marshall found gold in the sawmill then someone got gold in a bottle and showed it to san francisco and the news spread to the east, after the president said that they can go to the west. Then in 1853 it stopped no more gold! So let's talk about the tools.

Basic Tools

According to What Was the Gold Rush the 49ers had many tools. we are going to see the basic tools. the set up is a pan shovel and a pick. They used the pan to get gold from the rivers.They use it by getting gravel from the river and swirl it around and and the gold will sink the others will not so, then the put the other stuff at the river leaving the gold. Then used the shovel to get gravel and put it in somewhere.  They used the pick to cut open ores and rock to get GOLD.(well sometimes they get gold)

Advanced Tools
People that are rich can buy more effectively tools so here is the Advanced tools. One of them is a sluice it a long piece of wood that the gold sinks but the gravel stays up.
But if you want to the work do a rocker you put soil and start to rock the tool the gold gets over but the soil gets under. Hydraulic mining was very efficient it was a large beam of water that could brake the side of a mountain and the gold will fall, but it got banned in 1853 because it hurt the landscape.
