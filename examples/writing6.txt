One of the first things we did with the data was to split it up into 4 groups and create charts based on the four different sets of numbers. We ended up with four different graphs that should each match up with our four sensors. Therefore to match up the graphs to your sensors we used the possible conditions and the unit measurements to infer what sensor should match with what graph. By possible conditions we mean the possible conditions for different sensors for example, for the temperature sensor the possible options are Lower temperatures that heat up quickly during daytime, Smooth constant temperatures that vary slightly throughout the day, and Lower temperatures that heat up quickly during daytime and cool off quickly at night. We noticed that for each sensor there were three possibilities. Another way we inferred what graphs matched up with what sensor was by brainstorming possible unit measurements and deciding if the data numbers were rational in the context of the unit. So once we established the possible units and all the possible conditions we were able to make reasonable guesses on what graphs represented what sensors. From here we looked at each graph individually and used the process of elimination.
