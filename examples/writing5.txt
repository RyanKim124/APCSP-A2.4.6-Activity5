Over the course of the play, the children and the parents have different relationships in each of the different houses. Romeo has more of a normal relationship with his parents than compared to Juliet, in which she had more strict parents. Romeo, compared to Juilet, has more caring family members. One example of Romeo’s caring family members is during the start of the play, Montague notes that “Many a morning hath he there been seen, With tears augmenting the fresh morning's dew, Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs. But all so soon as the all-cheering sun Should in the farthest east begin to draw The shady curtains from Aurora's bed, Away from light steals home my heavy son, And private in his chamber pens himself, Shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight out, And makes himself an artificial night. Black and portentous must this humor prove Unless good counsel may the cause remove” (124, Act 1, Scene 1). This shows that Romeo’s family is caring and sees that he is depressed. Juliet on the other hand, has more strict parents. One example of this is Juliet's parents almost forcing Juliet into marrying Paris. When Lady Capulet can not get Juliet to agree to marrying Paris, Capulet states that “LET How, how, how, how? Chopped logic! What is this? "Proud," and "I thank you," and "I thank you not," And yet "not proud"? Mistress minion you, Thank me no thankings, nor proud me no prouds, But fettle your fine joints' gainst Thursday next To go with Paris to Saint Peter's Church, Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither. Out, you green sickness, carrion! Out, you baggage! You tallow face!” (175, Act 3, Scene 5). This shows that Juliet’s Parents don’t care about Juliet’s feelings and only care about what Juliet does and who she marries.
